# MissingDataTraining

# TODO :


Check Variational training Error

Check convolutional destruction (error might come from architecture due to the deletion of last columns element)

Add a save method for long training and parameter exploration

When using variational, should round when calculating the probability ? Should round anyway ?

Optimization of patch destruction : Need to be ad hoc to pytorch

<!-- Utiliser un modÃ¨le D'ising ? -->


Use Unet architecvture or just convo (no linear) ?

Use permutation invariance

VAE with imputation multiple 

Try post Hoc method ?

Other Regularization method on the z not on pis


Problems with imputation, learnable parameter and cuda, find a better solve for the problem
