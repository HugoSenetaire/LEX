# MissingDataTraining

# TODO :

Add patch based destruction : OK

Check Variational training Error

Check convolutional destruction (error might come from architecture due to the deletion of last columns element)

Add a save method for long training and parameter exploration

Change data structure so that we have batch_size * Nexpectation rather than two different channels : OK

Add dataset for simple destruction : OK

When using variational, should round when calculating the probability ? Should round anyway ?

Optimization of patch destruction
