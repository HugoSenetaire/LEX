# MissingDataTraining

# TODO :

Add patch based destruction

Check Variational training Error

Check convolutional destruction (error might come from architecture due to the deletion of last columns element)

Add a save method for long training and parameter exploration

Change data structure so that we have batch_size * Nexpectation rather than two different channels

Add dataset for simple destruction
